# I am, emireri1498.
In this folder, there will be things i wish to share, whether it be a old Block Mesa related project or generally SC3.
              

My goodbye message:
Thank you to the staff team for keeping the server peaceful.
Thank you to the supporters for keeping the server up.
Thank you to everyone for shaping this amazing server.
Its saddening but, not everything lasts forever.
I wish luck to any SC3 revival project, might even contribute to some.
