# Hi! My name is Aybri.
And I used to play on SC3 and SC2.
I've collected various screenshots I've gained throughout my time on the server, as well as some art I made and posted. These are ones that I posted on the official SC3 Discord and the Minecraft Computer Mods Discord.

Sadly, I don't have all my screenshots. A lot of them are probably located on an old drive somewhere, but if I find them I will gladly update my archive.

Here's my goodbye message:

You can find me at [my website](https://aybri.org) if you want to see what I'm up to.
