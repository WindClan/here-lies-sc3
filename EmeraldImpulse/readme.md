# Hi! My name is Aybri.
And I used to play on SC3 and SC2.
I've collected various screenshots I've gained throughout my time on the server. These are ones that I posted on the official SC3 Discord and the Minecraft Computer Mods Discord.

Here's my goodbye message:

![You may or may not remember me, if you do, hi! 
I'm not gonna pretend I've been active in the server in recent months. Or MCCM, for that matter.
I'm also not gonna pretend like I really did anything too special. I never finished `\modemcat` (even though I made a whole-ass mascot for it, shoutout to those who remember Cory), I never actually finished that office building... The main thing I did was make a cool house and inspire others to make a town around it, and while it isn't a particularly "big" thing and is fairly local, I'm still grateful for it.
Oh yeah, I also was the gal that did the yard sales. That got quite a few people from all around, made a couple Krist off of it. That's what I'm probably remembered for, if at all lmao.

I don't know the full story behind why the server is shutting down, so I won't say too much in that regard. But either way, nothing lasts forever, and it was fun while it lasted.
I wish luck to those that seek to make a new server as a replacement, I wish luck to the admins and whatever they do next, and I wish luck to the community. I hope y'all manage to find a new place to make your cool stuff.](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/aybri/here-lies-sc3/main/EmeraldImpulse/goodbye.png)

You can find me at [my website](https://aybri.org) if you want to see what I'm up to.
